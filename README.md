# supply-chain-nft-gaming
tldr; a finer grain knowledge of 'use' of items or products, contributing to utility

## hypotheses
hypo1: there's more conservation of energy when coordinating offchain activity for when passing ownership along a chain.
hypo2: there's capacity for compute to be handled in clients to facilitate data transfer on transfer
hypo3: there's more paretopian value to be unlocked both in implementation and effect attempting this -> pass / fail by standards

goal: build ed25519 identities alongside nft address ownership at a protocol extension level for elevating gaming context industry lore

## contract level
### reading data
- must read aqua compiled js/ts from smart contract -> develop an interface
- create handshake protocol to pull data -> prior history + data + computed values -> pass to next owner for storage

### writing data
- games be connected to ed25519 peer identities for sending data for game context

## north stars: morgan's version
- knowing country ownership (/balance privacy)
- knowing finisher uses in finite games (/balance violence)
- knowing wear and tear on a tool (/balance utility)
- knowing what accolades something has contributed to (build / create) (/balance status)
- passed credentials from owner to owner

## north stars: chatgpt
- knowing proof of skill for player character information
- timelocked content
- contextual bets being placed
- license content to be used in other AI agents
- genetic breeding of in-game items from compiled from offchain data
- education achievements as nfts roles
